# Postmortem
Issue: The user encountered an "Run Nginx as Nginx" issue while working on a Web stack debugging project. When they tried to execute the command sed -i s/80/8080/g /etc/nginx/sites-available/default, they received the error message sed: can't read /etc/nginx/sites-available/default: No such file or directory.

# Troubleshooting Steps:

The user checked the system logs by running the command sudo journalctl -xe and found the error message "sudo: unknown user: nginx".
Further investigation revealed that the Nginx user did not exist on the system.
The user created the Nginx user with the command sudo adduser nginx and then restarted the Nginx service with the command sudo systemctl restart nginx.service.
Next Issue: After restarting the Nginx service, the user encountered the error message "Failed to restart nginx.service: Interactive authentication required. See system logs and 'systemctl status nginx.service' for details."

# Troubleshooting Steps:

The user checked the system logs by running the command sudo journalctl -xe and found that the error was due to user permission issues.
The user updated the permissions for the Nginx user by running the command sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/html and then restarted the Nginx service with the command sudo systemctl restart nginx.service.
Resolution: After updating the permissions for the Nginx user, the user was able to successfully access the webpage hosted on the Nginx server.

Conclusion: The issue was caused by the absence of the Nginx user on the system, and then by incorrect user permissions. The user was able to resolve the issue by creating the Nginx user and updating the permissions.

Postmortem: Nginx Server Failure
# Summary
On May 13, 2023, at approximately 11:20 PM, the Nginx web server on our web stack debugging project failed to restart after a configuration change. The issue was caused by incorrect user permissions and was resolved by granting the necessary permissions to the user. A subsequent attempt to access the web page was successful.

# Timeline
11:00 PM: A configuration change was made to the Nginx web server to change the default port from 80 to 8080.
11:20 PM: A restart of the Nginx web server was attempted, but failed with an "Interactive authentication required" error.
11:22 PM: System logs were checked and revealed that the error was due to user permission issues.
11:24 PM: The necessary user permissions were granted and the Nginx web server was successfully restarted.
11:25 PM: An attempt to access the web page was successful.
# Root Cause
The root cause of the Nginx web server failure was due to incorrect user permissions, specifically the user not having sufficient permissions to restart the server.

# Resolution
The issue was resolved by granting the necessary permissions to the user, allowing them to successfully restart the Nginx web server.

# Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will implement the following measures:

Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure they have the necessary access to perform their tasks.
Create a backup of the Nginx configuration file before making any changes to avoid potential errors.
Regularly monitor the system logs to detect and address any issues that may arise.
Humor
We know that postmortems can be a bit dry, so we've added a bit of humor to keep things interesting. Just remember, laughter is the best medicine (unless you have diarrhea, in which case, avoid it at all costs).

- Q: Why was the Nginx web server feeling lonely?
- A: Because it had no port to call home!

I hope you found this postmortem informative and entertaining. Remember, don't take yourself too seriously, even in the face of technical difficulties. Happy debugging!
